This site is a work in progress prototype, to demonstrate and test a new approach to publishing information from the Civil Service People Survey. It is being developed in the open to enable end-user consultation and feedback.

More complete information about the survey, including historical datasets, is available from [Civil Service People Survey hub](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/civil-service-people-survey-hub) on GOV.UK.
